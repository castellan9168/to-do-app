How to start app

run command "gulp watch" in one console
run command "mongod --dbpath database path" to connect to database

A simple to-do-app with MEAN stack

- [ ] build details page of a task
- [ ] add edit functionality for the task
- [ ] finish configuring gulp-remove-code
- [ ] add feature to have more than one tag and reminder for the task
- [ ] create side menu
- [ ] I don't understand why after POST the user connects two times with database to retrieve list of tasks
- [ ] Currently delete taks uses POST method. It would be neat to use DELETE method, but it requires more coding
